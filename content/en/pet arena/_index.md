| **5th Place**     | $250       |
| Honorable Mentions| Recognition|
| *All Participants*| *Certificate of Completion (for at least one mission)* |


## üéØ The Challenge: 5 Missions, 3 Tracks

Participants will gain access to a simulated database with various static and evolving datasets. Your objective is to design and execute privacy attacks across five missions of varying difficulty.

- **Detect** database membership.
- **Infer** sensitive attributes.
- **Reconstruct** sensitive user records.
- **Link** records across tables.
- **Innovate** in an Open Mission to showcase a novel attack.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Selection & Scoring Criteria

Success is measured by a comprehensive scoring matrix that quantifies performance. The only subjective judgment is for the "Open Mission" track, available after achieving a minimum score in other missions.

Scoring will consider the following criteria:
1.  **Type of attack** and the severity of the privacy compromise.
2.  **Attack metrics** (e.g., TPR, FPR, AUC, MSE).
3.  **Attack detectability** (i.e., stealth).
4.  **Attack complexity** and novelty.
5.  **Attacker's strength** and assumed prior knowledge.
6.  **Attack robustness** against different levels of privacy protection.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can solo applicants apply?**
<br>A: Yes! Individuals are welcome, but we encourage teams of 2‚Äì4 to bring diverse expertise to the challenge.

**Q: Is travel funding available for the award ceremony?**
<br>A: Limited travel stipends are available for top-placing teams based on need. Others are encouraged to seek support from their home institutions.

**Q: Are non-academic or industry teams eligible?**
<br>A: Absolutely. We welcome industry professionals and independent researchers.

**Q: What kind of datasets will we be attacking?**
<br>A: You will work with a combination of synthetic data and public, real-world datasets adapted for the competition.
