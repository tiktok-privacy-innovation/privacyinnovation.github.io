title: "PET ARENA: Differential Privacy CTF Competition"
date: 2025-07-24T08:00:00Z
draft: false
---

A hands-on CTF competition with the objective of breaking privacy protection mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy) with various techniques, including machine learning, in an interactive database setting. Participants will gain access to a simulated DBS with various static and evolving datasets through a query client, and assume the role of malicious analysis.

### The Challenge

Participants will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks through 5 missions in 3 tracks. The tracks and missions are of various difficulty levels and invite participants to:

*   Detect database membership
*   Infer sensitive attributes
*   Reconstruct sensitive user records
*   Link records across tables
*   Perform other innovative attacks in an Open Mission

### Prizes and Awards

A panel of cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach and technical soundness of attacks and award the most successful teams/individuals.

*   **1st place:** $5,000
*   **2nd place:** $2,000
*   **3rd place:** $1,000
*   **Honorable Mentions**
*   **Certificates** for participants who have completed at least one mission.

### Contest Details

The contest has a total duration of **50 days**, with an official kick-off on **August 1st, 2025**. All missions should be completed by no later than **September 19, 2025** (anywhere in the world). Successful teams will be notified by **October 25th** and will be invited for a hybrid award ceremony (location to be determined). A limited need-basis travel budget is available upon request.

### Selection Criteria

Success in this hackathon is measured by a comprehensive scoring matrix that objectively quantifies participant performance across each mission. The only area involving subjective judgment is the "Open Ended Exploration" mission within Track 3.

Scoring will consider the following criteria:
1.  Type of attack and privacy compromise
2.  Attack metrics (e.g., TPR, FPR, AUC, MSE, etc.)
3.  Attack detectability
4.  Attack complexity
5.  Attacker's strength and prior knowledge
6.  Attack robustness to different levels and types of privacy protection mechanisms
