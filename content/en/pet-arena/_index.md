## PET ARENA: Differential Privacy CTF Competition

A hands-on CTF competition with the objective of breaking privacy protection mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy) with various techniques, including machine learning, in an interactive database setting. Participants will gain access to a simulated DBS with various static and evolving datasets through a query client, and assume the role of malicious analysis.

Participants will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks through 5 missions in 3 tracks. The tracks and missions are of various difficulty levels and invite participants to detect database membership, infer sensitive attributes, reconstruct sensitive user records, link records across tables, and other innovative attacks in an Open Mission.

### Prizes & Recognition

A panel of cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach and technical soundness of attacks, and award the most successful teams/individuals based on the following prizes:

| Placement          | Prize       |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **1st place**      | **$10,000** |
| **2nd place**      | $5,000      |
| **3rd place**      | $2,000      |
| **4th place**      | $1,000      |
| **5th place**      | $500        |
| Honorable Mentions | Recognition |
| Certificates for participants who have completed at least one mission. | |

### How to Join

We invite any privacy, security, machine learning, and/or data expert, research, and engineers to participate by submitting a credentials application using **[this link](https://forms.gle/QUNnCsfLitHBKTfeA)**. We especially encourage undergraduate or graduate students in the fields of privacy, security, data science, ML, and engineering or related fields to apply.

### Who can apply?
Teams of 1–4 members (students, researchers, industry professionals) with expertise in privacy, security, ML, or data engineering from anywhere around the world.

### How to apply?
Submit via application via **[this link](https://forms.gle/QUNnCsfLitHBKTfeA)**. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. **Final deadline to apply: September 10th 2025.**

Applications should include:
- Team bios (names, affiliations, roles).
- Valid email
- CVs of all team members.
- Team Lead (if Team)
- Code samples or prior work (GitHub links accepted). This is optional.

### Contest details

The contest has a total duration of 50 days, with an official kick-off on **August 1st 2025**. All missions should be completed by no later than **September 19, 2025** (anywhere in the world). Successful teams will be notified by **October 25th** and will be invited for a hybrid award ceremony (location to be determined).

### Selection Criteria

Success in this hackathon is measured by a comprehensive scoring matrix that objectively quantifies participant performance across each mission. The only area involving subjective judgment is the "Open Ended Exploration" mission within Track 3, which will be available to participants who successfully gather a minimum score in lower missions and tracks.

Scoring will consider the following critera:
1. Type of attack and privacy compromise
2. Attack metrics (e.g., TPR, FPR, AUC, MSE, etc.)
3. Attack detectability 
4. Attack complexity
5. Attacker's strength and prior knowledge
6. Atack robustness to different levels and types of privacy protection mechanisms

### FAQ

**Q: Can solo applicants apply?**
<br>A: Yes! Individuals are welcome, but teams of 2–4 are encouraged for diverse expertise.

**Q: Is travel funding available?**
<br>A: No. Teams are incentivized to seek support from their institutions.

**Q: Are non-academic teams eligible?**
<br>A: Absolutely—industry professionals and independent researchers are welcome.

**Q: What datasets will we use?**
<br>A: Synthetic and public real-world data.
