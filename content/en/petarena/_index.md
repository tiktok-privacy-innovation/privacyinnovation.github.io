A hands-on CTF competition with the objective of breaking privacy protection mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy) with various techniques, including machine learning, in an interactive database setting. Participants will gain access to a simulated DBS with various static and evolving datasets through a query client, and assume the role of malicious analysis.

## üéØ The Challenge: 5 Missions in 3 Tracks

Participants will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks through 5 missions in 3 tracks. The tracks and missions are of various difficulty levels and invite participants to:
- Detect database membership
- Infer sensitive attributes
- Reconstruct sensitive user records
- Link records across tables
- Launch other innovative attacks in an Open Mission

## üèÜ Prizes & Recognition

A panel of cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach and technical soundness of attacks, and award the most successful teams/individuals based on the following prizes:

| Placement         | Prize       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **1st Place**     | **$10,000** |
| **2nd Place**     | $5,000      |
| **3rd Place**     | $2,000      |
| **4th Place**     | $1,000      |
| **5th Place**     | $500        |
| Honorable Mentions| Recognition |
| *All Participants*| *Certificate of Completion (for at least one mission)* |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Selection & Scoring Criteria

Success in this hackathon is measured by a comprehensive scoring matrix that objectively quantifies participant performance across each mission. The only area involving subjective judgment is the "Open Ended Exploration" mission within Track 3, which will be available to participants who successfully gather a minimum score in lower missions and tracks.

Scoring will consider the following criteria:
1.  Type of attack and privacy compromise
2.  Attack metrics (e.g., TPR, FPR, AUC, MSE, etc.)
3.  Attack detectability
4.  Attack complexity
5.  Attacker's strength and prior knowledge
6.  Attack robustness to different levels and types of privacy protection mechanisms

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
