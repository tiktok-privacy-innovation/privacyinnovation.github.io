### Building PETAce-Network

We assume that all commands presented below are executed in the root directory of PETAce-Network.

To build PETAce-Network library (optionally with test and example):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNETWORK_BUILD_TEST=ON -DNETWORK_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON
cmake --build build
```

Output binaries can be found in `build/lib/` and `build/bin/` directories.
