### Building PETAce-Solo

We assume that all commands presented below are executed in the root directory of PETAce-Solo.

To build PETAce-Solo library (optionally with test, benchmark, and example):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DSOLO_BUILD_TEST=ON -DSOLO_BUILD_BENCH=ON -DSOLO_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON
cmake --build build
```

Output binaries can be found in `build/lib/` and `build/bin/` directories.
