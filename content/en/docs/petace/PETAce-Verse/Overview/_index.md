## PETAce-Verce
<!-- start-petace-verse-overview -->

PETAce-Verse is a collection of primitive cryptographic protocols.
It is one of the many components in [the framework PETAce](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce).

PETAce-Verse implements frequently, repeatedly called subprotocols, as implied by the same "Verse".
Examples are oblivious transfer, oblivious pseudorandom functions, (vector) oblivious linear evaluation, etc.
Currently, PETAce-Verse includes: [Naor-Pinkas OT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/365411.365502), [IKNP OT](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_9) with [optimization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-016-9236-6), and [KKRT OT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978381).
