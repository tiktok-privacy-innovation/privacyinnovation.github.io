## PETAce-SetOps
<!-- start-petace-setops-overview -->

PETAce-SetOps is a collection of protocols that perform private set operations.
It is one of the many components in [the framework PETAce](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce).

Private set operations generally include private set intersection (PSI), private join and compute (PJC), and private information retrieval (PIR) protocols.
Currently, PETAce-SetOps implements the ECDH-PSI protocol based on Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman, the [KKRT-PSI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978381) protocol based on Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF), and the PJC protocol based on [Circuit-PSI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356421123_Circuit-PSI_With_Linear_Complexity_via_Relaxed_Batch_OPPRF).
