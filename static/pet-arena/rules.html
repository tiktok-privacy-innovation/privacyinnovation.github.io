            <h2>1. Introduction & Competition Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the inaugural PET ARENA CTF COMPETITION, sponsored by TikTok Inc., a hands-on Capture the Flag (CTF) competition with the objective of breaking privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and protection mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy) with a mix of techniques, including machine learning, in an interactive database setting.</p>
            <p>Participants will gain access to a simulated Database System (DBS) with static and evolving datasets through a dedicated SQL query client. Assuming the role of a malicious analyst, teams will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks across six missions organized into three tracks. The tracks and missions are of various difficulty levels and invite participants to perform database membership inference, infer sensitive attributes, reconstruct sensitive user records, link records across tables, and devise other innovative attacks in a final open mission.</p>
            <p>A panel of distinguished cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach, technical soundness, and real-world impact of the submitted attacks.</p>
            <p>This document outlines the official rules, regulations, and procedures for all participants. By submitting an application, all participants agree to be bound by these rules.</p>

            <h3>3.1. Team Composition</h3>
            <p>Teams must consist of a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of four (4) members. We invite any privacy, security, machine learning, and/or data expert, researcher, and engineer to participate. We especially encourage undergraduate or graduate students in these or related fields.</p>
            <h3>3.2. Team Lead</h3>
            <p>Each team must designate one member as the "Team Lead." The Team Lead will be the primary point of contact for all official communications from the competition organizers.</p>
            <h3>3.3. Global Participation</h3>
            <p>The competition is open to participants from anywhere in the world, unless prohibited by local law or U.S. export control regulations.</p>
            <h3>3.4. Conflicts of Interest</h3>
            <p>Employees, contractors, and immediate family members of the organizing committee, judging panel, and sponsoring organizations are ineligible to participate for monetary prizes but may participate unofficially.</p>

            <h2>4. Application and Vetting Process</h2>
            <h3>4.1. Application Submission</h3>
            <p>All prospective teams must submit a single application via the official application link. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.</p>
            <h3>4.2. Required Information</h3>
            <p>The application must include: Team Name, a designated Team Lead, full names, affiliations, and roles of all team members, a valid contact email address for the Team Lead, a brief team biography outlining individual expertise, and (optional) links to code samples or prior work.</p>
            <h3>4.3. Vetting</h3>
            <p>The organizing committee will vet all applications to ensure compliance with eligibility requirements. The committee reserves the right to approve or deny any application at its sole discretion. Successful applicants will receive credentials to access the competition environment.</p>

            <h3>5.2. Tracks and Missions</h3>
            <p>The competition is divided into three tracks, containing a total of six missions.</p>
            <h3>5.3. Objective</h3>
