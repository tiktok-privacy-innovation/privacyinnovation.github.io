            <h1>TikTok PET ARENA: Differential Privacy CTF Competition</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A hands-on CTF competition with the objective of breaking privacy protection mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy) with various techniques, including machine learning, in an interactive database setting.</p>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevBIbRjwXOeEGe6b0s2sfWeT9_YxLdVp898n6AKPxZLc7wQQ/viewform" class="button-primary">Apply Now &ndash; Last day to join: Sept 10, 2025</a>

        <section class="container content-section">
            <h2>Competition Overview</h2>
            <p>Participants will gain access to a simulated DBS with various static and evolving datasets through a query client, and assume the role of malicious analysis. Participants will design and execute novel or known privacy attacks through 5 missions in 3 tracks. The tracks and missions are of various difficulty levels and invite participants to detect database membership, infer sensitive attributes, reconstruct sensitive user records, link records across tables, and other innovative attacks in an Open Mission.</p>
            <p>A panel of cybersecurity and privacy experts will judge the innovative approach and technical soundness of attacks, and award the most successful teams/individuals.</p>

            <h2>Prizes</h2>
            <ul class="prize-list">
                <li><strong>1st place:</strong> $10,000 USD</li>
                <li><strong>2nd place:</strong> $5,000 USD</li>
                <li><strong>3rd place:</strong> $2,000 USD</li>
                <li><strong>4th place:</strong> $1,000 USD</li>
                <li><strong>5th place:</strong> $500 USD</li>
                <li>Honorable Mentions</li>
                <li>Certificates for participants who have completed at least one mission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Can Apply?</h2>
            <p>We invite any privacy, security, machine learning, and/or data expert, researcher, and engineer to participate. We especially encourage undergraduate or graduate students in the fields of privacy, security, data science, ML, and engineering or related fields to apply. Teams of 1–4 members (students, researchers, industry professionals) from anywhere around the world are welcome.</p>

            <h2>How to Apply</h2>
            <p>Submit your application via the official link. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. <strong>Final deadline to apply: September 10th 2025.</strong></p>
            <p>Applications should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team bios (names, affiliations, roles).</li>
                <li>Team Lead (if a Team).</li>
                <li>Valid email.</li>
                <li>CVs of all team members.</li>
                <li>Code samples or prior work (GitHub links accepted). This is optional.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Contest Details</h2>
            <p>The contest has a total duration of 50 days, with an official kick-off on August 10th 2025. All missions should be completed by no later than September 29, 2025 (anywhere in the world). Successful teams will be notified by October 30th and will be invited for a hybrid award ceremony (location to be determined).</p>

            <h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
            <p>Success in this hackathon is measured by a comprehensive scoring matrix that objectively quantifies participant performance across each mission. The only area involving subjective judgment is the "Open Ended Exploration" mission within Track 3. For more information, please refer to the <a href="rules.html">rules and regulations</a>.</p>
            <p>Scoring will consider the following criteria:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Type of attack and privacy compromise</li>
                <li>Attack metrics (e.g., TPR, FPR, AUC, MSE, etc.)</li>
                <li>Attack detectability</li>
                <li>Attack complexity</li>
                <li>Attacker's strength and prior knowledge</li>
                <li>Attack robustness to different levels and types of privacy protection mechanisms</li>
